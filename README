  Introduction
  Demo
  Program description

Introduction: --
The programs, including two parts, were separated into two folders.
``Feature trajectory-based stereoscopic video stabilization'' in 2d/;
``Camera trajectory-based stereoscopic video stabilization'' in 3d/.

Both programs can be executed under Linux operating system.
However, camera trajectory-based method (3d) may need some
pre-computation by MATLAB, and Zhang et al.'s ACTS software in

  http://www.zjucvg.net/acts/acts.html




Demo:
To demo the feature trajectory-based method (2D), go into the 
`2d/src/' folder, and types command 
`sh run_script.sh csiegirl_short':

  [root@home: ~/codes/2d/src]$ sh run_script.sh csiegirl_short

The shell script will run the binary executable files in the 
`2d/bin/', then the output video could be found at 
`2d/out/csiegirl_short_l/' and `2d/out/csiegirl_short_r/'.

To demo the camera trajectory-based method (3D), go into the
`3d/src/' folder, and open MATLAB

  [root@home: ~/codes/3d/src]$ MATLAB

Run the MATLAB script `run_script.m' by typing following 

  >> run_script('csiegirl')

The output video frames could be found at
`3d/out/csiegirl_l/' and `3d/out/csiegirl_r/'



Program description:
The prototype programs are not well written. You need some preprocessing
before stabilizing your own stereoscopic videos. 
For example, your stereo video, say `YOURVIDEO.AVI' have to do following:

In 2D:
1. It has to be separated into left and right image frames with name
   `2d/dat/img/YOURVIDEO_l/YOURVIDEO_%04d_l.png' and
   `2d/dat/img/YOURVIDEO_r/YOURVIDEO_%04d_r.png', where %04d refer to 
   a 4 digit integer to represent the frame number of that image.

In 3D:
1. It have to be separated into left and right image frames with name
   `3d/dat/img/YOURVIDEO_l/%04d.jpg' and
   `3d/dat/img/YOURVIDEO_r/%04d.jpg', where %04d refer to 
   a 4 digit integer to represent the frame number of that image.

2. Make sure you have left and right `camera file' from ACTS with name
   `3d/log/cameras/YOURVIDEO_l.cameras' and
   `3d/log/cameras/YOURVIDEO_r.cameras'.

3. Make sure you have left and right 'scene file' from ACTS with name
   `3d/log/scenes/YOURVIDEO_l.scenes' and
   `3d/log/scenes/YOURVIDEO_r.scenes'.

After that, you can use the program to stabilize your videos.
As demo procedure, just replace the input parameter from 
`csiegirl' to `YOURVIDEO'.
